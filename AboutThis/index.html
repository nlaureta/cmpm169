							<h2 class="title">Imitate</h2>
							<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and
								learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others,
								analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand
								how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can
								gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and
								identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>

						<article class="tile is-child box notification is-info">
							<h2 class="title">Integrate</h2>
							<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation
								by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from
								different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing
								together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining
								elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>

						<article class="tile is-child box notification is-success">
							<h2 class="title">Innovate</h2>
							<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking
								creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new
								techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By
								innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.

								innovate" design
								process to understand and creatively extend new code:</p>
							<p class="has-text-centered">Together, these three steps represent a process of starting
								with existing
								coding techniques and strategies, building upon them by combining them with other
								elements, and
								ultimately introducing new or original ideas to create something innovative. By
								following this
								process, we can learn, integrate, and extend new coding techniques and strategies in a
								way that is
								both grounded in proven concepts and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
